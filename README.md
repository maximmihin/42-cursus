## About 42

42 is a global education initiative that offers a new way of learning technology: no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process* - the so-called "Piscine" - becoming thus "cadets" (42's students).
